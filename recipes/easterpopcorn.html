    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This popcorn is an easy and festive way to enjoy some leftover Easter candy! You
        can use any kind of candy, nuts, or "mix-ins" that you like! And make sure to adjust the
        salt at the end, it really helps to balance out the sweetness! Make sure to store this
        in a cool, dry, and airtight container, or the popcorn will become soft. It should be
        eaten within a few days of being made.</p>
